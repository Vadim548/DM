Max-cut is implemented in C++: full bruteforce; greedy algorithm and greedy clustering for genetic algorithm - not fully implemented, yet gives right results for sparse graphs. Goemans-Williamson algorithm is working incorrectly in C++ and is working in Python. However, Python code is taken from the video you have shared and is modified to parse the input format.

Output example:
     0     0     0    40     0
     0     0     0     0     0
     0     0     0    30    30
    40     0    30     0     0
     0     0    30     0     0
